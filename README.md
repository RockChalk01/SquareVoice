# SquareVoice
SquareVoice is software that turns a computer into an augmentative and alternative communication device (AAC device).  It is intended to be basic with a focus on ease of use both for the user and the facilitator.  It is supports eye gaze (eye control) via the Tobii eye-x directly, or any eye gaze solution that allows the user to trigger a mouse click in a desired location.
