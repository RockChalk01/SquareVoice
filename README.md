# SquareVoice
SquareVoice is software that turns a computer into an augmentative and alternative communication device (AAC device).  It is intended to be basic with a focus on ease of use both for the user and the facilitator.  It is supports eye gaze (eye control) via the Tobii eye-x directly, or any eye gaze solution that allows the user to trigger a mouse click in a desired location.  

SquareVoice is not intended to be the most advanced ACC software available.  Instead it intends to fill the niche of a very easy to use entry-level eye gaze AAC solution.  It is especially targeted to users who have never used eye-gaze before.  It won't be the best solution for everyone (and maybe not even most), and it is recommended that any users consult with a qualified therapist or medical professional before deciding on a solution.   

##What Squarevoice provides:
A software package for representing words and ideas as images and text on a grid of arbitrary size.  It supports an arbitrary number of pages, with each page consisting of user-specified number of columns.  For each cell in the grid, a user can select a picture, text, and any number of actions that will trigger when the cell is selected (i.e. speak some text, load a different page, etc.)  This application provides for either clicking the cells using a mouse or a touchscreen.  It natively supports the Tobii eye-x eye gaze hardware, but should also support any eye gaze hardware that can trigger a mouse click in a selected square
    
##What SqureVoice does not provide:
The biggest thing that SquareVoice does not provide is a picture set.  The picture set is a huge part of an AAC solution, and you will have to source it somewhere else.  
  
  
##Where to find suitable pictures:

###1) http://lessonpix.com/  
This site charges $36 per year, but given that it includes a bunch of appropriate pictures AND the PRC Unity picture set for that price, I find it a bargain.  Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with this site, other than as a customer.
###2) http://www.sclera.be/en/vzw/home
This site provides a free set of pictures that may be suitable
###3) Google image search
This is do-able, but it may be hard to come up with a picture set that doesn't seem cobbled together since the pictures come from so many sources.
